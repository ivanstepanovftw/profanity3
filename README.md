# profanity3

Vanity search for Ethereum and Tron crypto addresses.
- Cryptocurrencies:
  - Ethereum
  - Tron
- OpenCL accelerated. Expect around 250 Mkey/s on "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU".
- Cryptographically secure source of randomness:
  - Windows: CryptGenRandom
  - Other OS: [`/dev/urandom`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random)
- `--matching` supports simple wildcard with only one `*` character.
- Currently, limited number of matches. As in the original project.

## Build
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ivanstepanovftw/profanity3.git
cd profanity3
make
```

## Run

See help:
```terminal
$ ./profanity.x64 --help
usage: ./profanity [OPTIONS]

  Basic modes:
    --benchmark             Run without any scoring, a benchmark.
    --zeros                 Score on zeros anywhere in hash.
    --letters               Score on letters anywhere in hash.
    --numbers               Score on numbers anywhere in hash.
    --mirror                Score on mirroring from center.
    --leading-doubles       Score on hashes leading with hexadecimal pairs

  Modes with arguments:
    --leading <single hex>  Score on hashes leading with given hex character.
    --matching <hex string> Score on hashes matching given hex string.

  Advanced modes:
    --contract              Instead of account address, score the contract
                            address created by the account's zeroth transaction.
    --leading-range         Scores on hashes leading with characters within
                            given range.
    --range                 Scores on hashes having characters within given
                            range anywhere.

  Range:
    -m, --min <0-15>        Set range minimum (inclusive), 0 is '0' 15 is 'f'.
    -M, --max <0-15>        Set range maximum (inclusive), 0 is '0' 15 is 'f'.

  Device control:
    -s, --skip <index>      Skip device given by index.
    -n, --no-cache          Don't load cached pre-compiled version of kernel.

  Tweaking:
    -w, --work <size>       Set OpenCL local work size. [default = 64]
    -W, --work-max <size>   Set OpenCL maximum work size. [default = -i * -I]
    -i, --inverse-size      Set size of modular inverses to calculate in one
                            work item. [default = 255]
    -I, --inverse-multiple  Set how many above work items will run in
                            parallell. [default = 16384]

  Examples for TRX:
    ./profanity --tron --matching TRY*4chan

  Examples for ETH:
    ./profanity --leading f
    ./profanity --matching dead
    ./profanity --matching badXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXbad
    ./profanity --matching "bad*bad"
    ./profanity --leading-range -m 0 -M 1
    ./profanity --leading-range -m 10 -M 12
    ./profanity --range -m 0 -M 1
    ./profanity --contract --leading 0

  Disclaimer:
    Always verify that a private key generated by this program corresponds to
    the public key printed by importing it to a wallet of your choice. This
    program like any software might contain bugs and it does by design cut
    corners to improve overall performance.

### Ethereum
Match `0xdead` at the beginning of the address:
```terminal
$ ./profanity.x64 --matching 123456789
...
  Time:     1s Score:  3 Private: 0xf269a197515712dd73e4e52962206ef61115df236e5d043e2da82597e60d23ac Address: 0xe734db789efb7efb6f3f67ccaf74d34b2f4262b7

Total: 464.213 MH/s - GPU0: 464.213 MH/s
``` 

### Tron

# profanity
This project was abandoned by me a couple of years ago. Fundamental security issues in the generation of private keys have been brought to my attention. See: https://github.com/johguse/profanity/issues/61

I strongly advice against using this tool in its current state. This repository will soon be further updated with additional information regarding this critical issue.

## 2022-09-15
All affected binaries have been removed to prevent further unsafe use of this tool, please see the following article for more information:

https://blog.1inch.io/a-vulnerability-disclosed-in-profanity-an-ethereum-vanity-address-tool-68ed7455fc8c

## 2022-09-15
As per issue 76 (https://github.com/johguse/profanity/issues/76) I've decided to also archive this repository to further reduce risk that someone uses this tool. The code will not recieve any updates and I've left it in an uncompilable state. Use something else!
